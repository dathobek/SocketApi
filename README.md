## Get Started
Create a directory,Cd into that directory and type the code:
npm init
Follow the instructions and fill in where necessary.
Then make a new file,let that file be an html file,also
create a javascript file where you Api will reside.

##Notes
If this repo is cloned,it wont run because its a tutorial repo for understanding socket.io.Thanks

## Updates 
Enter my repo in the api.js file,i did a simple 'hello world' with express 
server and socket.io.Added a script source to socket.io in my index.html.

## Event handler
Going back to the api.js file,you will observe how i handled both a default Event and a Custom event.I also used the 'emit event' from the client,an emit function on the socket object in index.html file.
